Subject: [UCC::ProgComp] Competition schedule

Hello,

Committee has decided to use the 4th Saturday of each month from May until 
October for progcomp.

So, here is a tentative schedule:

5th April - Bug fixing day / Day for bugging the organiser
25th May - Round 1
22nd June - Round 2
27th July - Round 3
24th August - Round 4
21st September - Round 5
26th October - Finals

We might end up doing fewer rounds, but the finals will be in October.

I will generally try and be around in UCC Clubroom on the days listed, but 
obviously physical presence is not necessary to compete.

Scores will be weighted so that the finals are worth 50%, 
and the other rounds are worth equal amounts.

[SZM]
Vice President 2013
