<h1> What API do I use? </h1>

<p> If you are <b>not</b> using python, your agent will use the <a href="agent_text.html"/>text based API</a> </p>
<p> If you are using python, you should use the <a href="agent_python.html"/>python API</a>. But you don't have to. </p>

<hr>

<h2> I've read that, but don't know where to start </h2>

<ol>
	<li> Pick a language. Python is recommended for beginners. </li>
	<li> Look at the sample agents. Here is the <a href="../agents/sample"/>sample python agent</a> </li>
	<li> Copy sample and rewrite amazingly awesome quantum chess algorithm of supreme domination </li>
	<li> Profit </li>
</ol>
<hr>

<h2> That was too long; I didn't read it </h2>

<p> Read the <a href="../agents/sample"/>sample python agent</a> instead. </p>

<hr>

<h2> Policy on Threading and Forking </h2>

<p> <b> Don't do it. It is not allowed. Use a single thread like a real man/woman/robot. </b> </p>

<hr> 
<h2> This API seems terrible and I want to use threads</h2>

<p> Too bad. Write your own competition. </p>
